    <p className="text-center">
      Hi, welcome to Puppy Love. Here at Puppy Love it is our mission to helping
      dogs get a second chance back in the real world. There are hundreds of
      dogs in your area that could use your help, time, support, love and your
      home, more then you know.</p> 
      <p className="text-center"> Maybe you keep telling yourself that you don’t
      have the space and/or the time to own a dog but still love and want to
      spend time with our four legged companions, you’ve come to the right
      place. Shelters in your area are struggling do this with the overwhelming
      number of dogs that need your help, love and support. We would love to get
      these dogs back out into world but the shelters don’t have the time to
      take our fury little friends out and about, and that’s where you come in.
      These animals need to be walked, they need to be played with, they to
      interact with their canine pals so they can reinforce their social skills
      with good habits, but most all they need your LOVE!</p>
      <p className="text-center"> How it works; first we ask that you pass a simple background check, reason
      being for this is to insure that are dogs will not be harmed in any way, we love 
      of pups and need to insure their safety. These animals will be in your care for
      however much time you can spare. Then you will be asked a few simples
      questions to help us pair you with the dog that’s right for you. We will
      compile a list of dogs from a select number of shelters in your area. Now
      from this list you can choose a play date and time for however many hours
      would like to share. Now the first couple of times we ask that you spend
      the time there at the shelter, maybe playing help feeding or even bathing
      whatever you decide it’s your time. You may bring treats, toys or even new
      collar whatever your heart desires. On your third visit is where it gets
      fun, because this where you will be able to take your four legged
      companion out of the shelter. We recommend and ask that you take the dog
      for walks at the park or the beach, where ever there are other dogs and
      people, to help get these dogs re-acclimated with their canine pals and
      their best friends, US. We ask this for one main and important reason, we
      are trying to find homes for these pets and we feel the best way to do
      that is to get them out there mingling and associating themselves with
      others.</p>
      <p className="text-center"> To help with the adoption process we ask, after you meet your
      friend, that you leave some nice and loving comments about the time you
      spent with your dog. Write about him/hers type of personality,
      temperament, the things he/she likes to do; if they like to play ball or
      tug of war, maybe the type of treats they like, whatever you feel to help
      get these pups to a find a new home and family. Who knows maybe at the end
      of the day you might want to adopt your new friend and make him/her apart
      of your family, because puppy love is for love for everyone!
